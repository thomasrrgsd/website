# Space Invaders

This user program is an adaption of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. New features are currently being added. The program will not be a 1:1 port.

## To Do:
- Add basic text sprites.
- Add function to print text to graphics display.
- Add a basic menu with options for instructions, game play, or quiting.
- Game play will be super basic to begin with. The first thing to do is to get one alien working that can go back and forth on the screen and move downwards, and when it reaches a certain position, the game ends. Need to implement the quite key.
- The next addition will be the user ship.
- Next, a fire key is to be added.
- Then, collision with the alien that results in finishing the level is the last addition.
